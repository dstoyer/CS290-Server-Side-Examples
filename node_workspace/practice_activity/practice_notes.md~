# Activity: Practice

Notes on extending the to-do list with Open Weather queries and dynamically
changing content.

I copied the original to-do list code by hand to be sure that I understood each
line and what it does.

I used an existing JavaScript file and modified it with the to-do js code.

I forgot to add the body-parser middleware and received an error when trying to post a
name. The to-do list worked properly after adding the body-parser middleware.

Now that I have the to-do list web app working (confirmed adding and removing
items works properly), I want to extend it to adding a city and minimum
temperature for accomplishing the to-do, looking the city up
in Open Weather, getting the city temp, checking against the provided minimum
temp, then highlight the to-do in the list with a red or green background
depending on if the temperature is warm enough for the to-do.

An aside, I really like using markdown for note-taking, it is a really simple
formatting scheme. So, I found a markdown to pdf converter through npm. It can
be installed from the command line with "npm install -g markdown-pdf".

## Problem and Solution

**Problem Statement:**
+ Make sure you can create sessions, add and update different kinds of data to sessions and end sessions.

+ Make sure you can make HTTP requests, including POSTs, from the server and deal with the data you get back.  

+ Make sure that you can set up pages to accept data from forms.  

+ Make sure you can handle nested asynchronous requests and process errors if they crop up (force errors to happen by doing things like entering in the wrong URL).  

**Solution**
+ Extend the "to-do" web app by allowing users to:
	+ add cities to-do items need to happen in
	+ add min temp for to-do items  

+ Make HTTP calls to Open Weather Map to check if the current weather is good enough for the to-do.
	+ if temp is too low, to-do should be red
	+ if temp is right, to-do should be green.

## Steps for approaching the problem:

1. Allow the user to add cities to the to-do list.
	+ input field for the city name
	  First I want to look at how the to-do items are currents entered. Then I
want to see what the best format will be to enter a city name. After I have the
basic UI in place, I will test entering the data on the client and getting the
data on the server.
	+ display the city name in the to-do list.
	+ Should the city and temp be optional?
		+ Need to think about how to handle "yes" or "no" to optional.

1. Allow the user to add min temp.
	+ input field for the temp.
	+ display the temp in the to-do list.

1. After getting the UI part down for city and temp, implement making the call
   to Open Weather Map.

## Problems Encountered

+ The input boxes in the forms are not aligned. This looks really bad. I would
  like to find out how to align the boxes, if I have time.

+ The biggest challenge here is thinking through how to set up the asynchronous
  call to Open Weather.
	+ Initially I'm trying to do the request like from the AJAX homework.
	+ I've found that, while concepts are similar (asynchronous calls are
	  needed), I need to use the Express/Handlebars way of doing things to make
	  this work in the to-do app.
